Almost every developer wants to maintain a devlog. There are a few difficulties though. Here are the top 2 in my mind.

##Difficulties:

1. Laziness
2. Devs usually can't/don't want to reveal their work because of legal/marketing issues

##Solutions:

1. I have resolved not to be lazy. Trust me.
2. I work on open source stuff. So I don't think there'll be issues.

I am an active Twitter user but it is not suited for large posts. First, I experimented with just echoing text into a log file.

Example:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "Welcome to my devlog!" >> 08-12-2014.log
{% endhighlight %}

However, this approach did not seem comfortable.

1. I wanted timestamps and I didn't want to do them manually
2. I wanted to maintain them online instead of limiting myself to a local machine
3. I wanted to learn something new on the way

I remembered [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and that I had created one at [anirudh24seven.github.io](http://anirudh24seven.github.io/) long ago. I experimented around for a while and came upon [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com). It seemed to be just what I wanted.

So, here I am, serving up my first devlog with Jekyll and GitHub pages. Thanks GitHub!
