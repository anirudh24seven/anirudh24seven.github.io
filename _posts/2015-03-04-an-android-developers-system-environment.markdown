I am an Android developer and in this post I will share my working environment.

#### Machine
I use a Macbook Air 2014 model and it has been good enough for me. The battery life and the thin profile guarantee that I can use it anywhere I want.

#### IDE
I have been using Android Studio as my IDE for the last one year and it has been great. It is better than Eclipse in almost every aspect: Speed, sensible shortcuts, clean UI and integration with Gradle.

#### Emulator
Whenever I need the Emulator (eg. lower versions of Android), I prefer Genymotion over the default Emulator. It is blazing fast, feels smooth and even has drag-and-drop support.

#### Device
I own a Nexus 5 running Lollipop. I connect to it with a USB cable but also debug over WiFi whenever I feel fancy.

#### VCS
I use Git in all my projects. Using a GUI for Git helps a lot for looking at branches and commit history. SourceTree has been the best tool in that regard. I also use GitX sometimes.

#### Terminal
I am a fan of top-down terminals that can be invoked with a global shortcut. The context-switch doesn't feel heavy and this is very important to me. I used to have Yakuake on my Ubuntu machine and I wanted something similar on OS X. iTerm2 has been the best alternative on the Mac for me.

#### Browser
I used to prefer Firefox because of Mozilla's philosophy but Chrome looks and feels better. Chrome it is, for now.

#### Social
I am a very active user of Twitter and I use the TweetDeck app to keep myself updated. I also have a list of 100+ Android devs and columns in Tweetdeck are very useful to glance through all the lists I have.

#### Time keeper
It is easy to get distracted (especially with Twitter). I have tried out a few time-keeping tools and I have found RescueTime to be the best of them all. Check it out here: [http://rescuetime.com/](http://rescuetime.com/)
